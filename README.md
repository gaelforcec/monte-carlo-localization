# VEX REAL TIME MONTE CARLO LOCALIZATION

Team [5327C] VEX Robotics Competition code for the 2024 season.

## Features

  - Advanced Monte Carlo Localization with Kalman Filter fusion
  - Supports custom odometry tracking through `chassis.odom_tracking_set()`
  - Flexible integration with any tracking system (tracking wheels, distance sensors, imus)
  - Seamless fusion of multiple sensor inputs for robust position estimation
  - Real-time particle filtering with dynamic resampling
  - Kalman filter smoothing for precise state estimation
